README for GRT Hub - Web Scraping and Data Processing in Python
Overview
This Python code provides a comprehensive solution for web scraping and data analysis, specifically targeting real estate data from the website 'https://www.rockethomes.com/mi/ann-arbor'. It utilizes libraries such as requests, lxml, pandas, BeautifulSoup, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib to scrape, process, and organize data into a structured format.

Features
Web Scraping: Extracts data from a specific real estate website using requests and BeautifulSoup.
Data Cleaning and Transformation: Implements custom functions to clean and split data into meaningful attributes.
Data Analysis Ready: Organizes data into a pandas DataFrame for further analysis.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: requests, lxml, pandas, beautifulsoup4, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib
Installation
Ensure Python 3.x is installed. Install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install requests lxml pandas beautifulsoup4 numpy seaborn matplotlib
Usage
Data Collection: The script starts by making a request to the specified URL to fetch HTML content.
Data Extraction: It then parses HTML content to extract specific data points like prices, mortgage rates, size, address, beds, baths, and zip codes.
Data Processing:
Cleans and transforms extracted data.
Splits combined text (e.g., '2bedâ€¢3baths') into separate meaningful columns.
Dataframe Creation: The cleaned and processed data is then organized into a pandas DataFrame for easy analysis and visualization.
Functions
city_list(): Extracts and returns lists of various real estate attributes from the HTML content.
splitingg_bed_bath(badbeth): Splits and cleans the 'bed and bath' information into separate columns.
Output
Creates a pandas DataFrame df40 with columns: price, Morgae_rate, size, addresss, bed, bath, zip_code.
Limitations
The code is specifically tailored for the structure of the 'Rocket Homes' website. Changes in the website's HTML structure may require code adjustments.
It currently targets only the Ann Arbor, MI listings. To use it for other locations, the URL in the requests.get method must be modified.
Disclaimer
This script is intended for educational purposes. Ensure compliance with the website's terms of service and legal regulations regarding web scraping.
